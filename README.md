# Purpose
<br/><i>
The overtopping discharge estimations are computed from an empirical method explain in the Eurotop manual (http://www.overtopping-manual.com/).  These equations have been setup from the CLASH database (see below). However, the accuracy of theses equations is problematic when the inputs parameters are closed from the validation domain (who happens very often). 
<br/><br/>
The access to the CLASH database can allow the ML and DP utilizations for increase the accuracy of the overtopping discharges.<br/><br/>
The first step, here, is to define the possibilities given by the ML algorithms regressor. A simple Decision tree regressor and more complex model Gradient Boost regressor have been setup and compared. </i>
